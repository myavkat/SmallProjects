This does:
Gets a directory of a folder and a file type from user
Opens folders in that folder and searches for files from that type.
Collects them in a folder in mother folder and numerize them starting from 1.

That is all!

I made this to collect all manga chapters in a folder with right order and since this does work alphabetically it works good.
(Except I needed to rename folders that have 1 and 2 digit to 3 digit with adding 0 at the beginnings of numbers ex: 1 -> 001.)
